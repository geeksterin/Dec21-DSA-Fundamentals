1. Defining Stacks and creating stacks 
2. Inbuilt stack in java: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-class-in-java/

    Note: Please note that the Stack class in Java is a legacy class and inherits from Vector in Java. It is a thread-safe class and hence involves overhead when we do not need thread safety. It is recommended to use ArrayDeque for stack implementation as it is more efficient in a single-threaded environment.

3. Reverse word using stack.
