   Why a new data structure??
0. What is linked list : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/
1. Implementation : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-a-linked-list-in-java-using-class/
2. Time Complexity of various LinkedList operations.
    -> Insertion in front, middle and end.
    -> deletion in front, middle and end.
    -> Search.
3. Double Linked List aka doubly linkedlist.

4. Print the kth element from the end in a singly linkedlist.
5. Detect a cycle in a linked list.
  -> find the point of cycle formation.
6. Check if two linked list merge into 1 or not.
7. Merge two single linked list into 1 list.
8. Implement stack using linked list.
9. Implement queue using linked list.
