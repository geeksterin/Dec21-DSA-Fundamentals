# Binary Search Tree
## Operations on BST:
---------------------------------------------------
1. Insertion into BST 
2. Search in BST
3. Inorder traversal in BST -> sorted seqeuence
4. What is Inorder successor and inorder predecesor
   - how to find it.
5. Deletion in BST.

***Time Complexity on BST***
1. Insertion -> WC: O(N) , BC : O(lgN).
2. Search    -> WC: O(N) , BC : O(lgN).
3. Deletion  -> WC: O(N)
